## 🔧 Required: Add Anthropic API Key

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** You must add your Anthropic API key to Render for the system to work!

### Get Your API Key:
1. Go to https://console.anthropic.com
2. Sign up or log in
3. Navigate to "API Keys"
4. Create new key
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

### Add to Render:
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select service: **cazar-main** (srv-d25s25pr0fns73fj22gg)
3. Go to **Environment** tab
4. Click **Add Environment Variable**
5. Key: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
6. Value: `<paste-your-key>`
7. Click **Save Changes**
8. Render will auto-redeploy (if needed)

## 🚀 First-Time Setup (After Deployment)

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment
Wait 3-5 minutes for Render to complete deployment. Check:
- https://dashboard.render.com (your service logs)
- Service should show "Live" status

### Step 2: Initialize Database
Once deployed, run this once:

```bash
# Via curl or Postman
POST https://cazar-main.onrender.com/api/email-analytics/initialize
```

This creates the `email_analytics` table and all views.

### Step 3: First Email Sync
Sync emails (defaults to last 30 days):

```bash
POST https://cazar-main.onrender.com/api/email-analytics/sync
# Defaults to 30 days (720 hours)
# Or customize with: Body: { "hoursBack": 168 }
```

This will:
- Fetch emails from all mailboxes
- Analyze each with Claude 4.5
- Store in database with metadata
- Link responses to requests

**Note:** First sync may take 5-15 minutes depending on email volume.

### Step 4: Test a Query
Try a natural language query:

```bash
POST https://cazar-main.onrender.com/api/email-analytics/query
Body: { "query": "Show all PTO requests from the last 7 days" }
```

---

## 💬 Example Queries You Can Now Ask

### Via Smart Agent UI:
1. Enable "Email" or "Microsoft" database
2. Ask questions like:

```
"Show all PTO requests in the last 7 days with response status"
"Which driver requests haven't been answered in 48 hours?"
"What's the average response time for Fleet emails?"
"Show all uniform requests submitted in the past 14 days"
"Count total emails by category by day this month"
"List emails with attachments related to incidents"
"Show emails older than 48 hours without response"
"Who handles most payroll requests?"
"What's the turnaround time for scheduling requests?"
```

### Via Direct API:
Use the `/api/email-analytics/query` endpoint with any question!

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails:
1. Check Render logs for errors
2. Verify `package.json` updated correctly
3. Ensure no syntax errors in code

### If Queries Don't Work:
1. Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set
2. Check database was initialized
3. Run email sync first
4. Review API logs in Render

### If No Emails Found:
1. Run `/api/email-analytics/sync`
2. Check Microsoft Graph permissions
