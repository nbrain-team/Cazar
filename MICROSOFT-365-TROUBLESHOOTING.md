# Microsoft 365 Integration Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Smart Agent shows email sync logs but can't find emails when queried

**Status:** ‚ùå Requires Admin Consent in Azure Portal

---

## üîç What's Happening

Your system is correctly configured with Microsoft 365 credentials, but the API calls are **failing due to missing admin consent** for the required permissions. 

### Current Behavior:
- ‚úÖ Microsoft 365 is **enabled** in Smart Agent (default on)
- ‚úÖ Environment variables are configured
- ‚úÖ OAuth token acquisition attempts are made
- ‚ùå API calls return **403 Forbidden** errors
- ‚ùå User sees: "I don't have access to..." instead of email content

### What You're Seeing in Logs:
```
[Microsoft] Acquiring new access token...
[Microsoft] Searching emails for: "captains huddle"
[Microsoft] Error: Forbidden - Admin consent required
```

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Grant Admin Consent

### Quick Fix (5 minutes):

**1. Go to Azure Portal:**
```

```

**2. Click the button:**
```
‚ö° Grant admin consent for [Your Organization Name]
```

**3. Confirm:**

## üîß Advanced Troubleshooting

### If Admin Consent Button is Disabled:

**Cause:** You don't have Azure AD Administrator role

**Solution:**
1. Contact your IT administrator
2. Send them this information:
   - App Name: nBrain
   - App ID: `fe9e4018-6e34-4662-8989-18ef789f727d`
   - Required action: Grant admin consent for Microsoft Graph permissions
   - Link: https://portal.azure.com (search for app ID above)

### If Consent Granted but Still Not Working:

**Step 1: Wait for Propagation**
- Azure AD can take 5-10 minutes to propagate permissions
- Try again after waiting

**Step 2: Check Logs**
```bash
# On Render, check recent logs for:
[Microsoft] Successfully acquired access token
[Microsoft] Found X users to search
[Microsoft] Found Y emails for [user]
```

**Step 3: Clear Token Cache**
- Restart the Render service (forces new token acquisition)
- Dashboard ‚Üí cazar-ops-hub ‚Üí Manual Deploy ‚Üí Deploy Latest Commit

**Step 4: Verify Environment Variables**
```bash
# In Render dashboard, check these are set:
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=fe9e4018-6e34-4662-8989-18ef789f727d
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=***[should be set]***
MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID=6c2922d6-1e81-4857-a4b6-ee13a30f5b9d
MICROSOFT_REDIRECT_URI=https://cazar-main.onrender.com/auth/microsoft/callback
