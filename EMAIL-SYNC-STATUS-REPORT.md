---

## 🚨 Alerts & Recommendations

### ✅ What's Working Well
1. Email sync is functioning correctly
2. All 12+ mailboxes are being monitored
3. Claude AI categorization is working
4. Database is healthy and populated
5. Microsoft Graph integration is active

### ⚠️ Items Needing Attention

1. **Limited Historical Data**
   - Currently only 8 days of history (Oct 22-29)
   - Recommendation: Run a historical sync for past 30-60 days
   ```bash
   POST /api/email-analytics/sync
   Body: { "hoursBack": 1440 }  # 60 days
   ```

2. **No Automated Sync Schedule**
   - Currently requires manual trigger
   - Recommendation: Enable daily automated sync via cron
   - Location: `server/index.mjs` line 476 (currently just a placeholder)

3. **Sync Frequency**
   - Last sync was 24 hours ago
   - Recommendation: Sync at least daily (or twice daily for real-time tracking)

4. **Missing Environment Variable Check**
   - Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in Render
   - This is required for Claude AI analysis

---

## 🎯 Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Now)
1. **Verify API Key**
   ```bash
   # Check Render environment for ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   # Should start with: sk-ant-
   ```

2. **Run Daily Sync** (Manual for now)
   ```bash
   POST https://cazar-main.onrender.com/api/email-analytics/sync
   Body: { "hoursBack": 48 }  # Last 2 days
   ```

### Short Term (This Week)
1. **Backfill Historical Data**
   ```bash
   POST https://cazar-main.onrender.com/api/email-analytics/sync
   Body: { "hoursBack": 1440, "background": true }  # 60 days
   ```

2. **Enable Automated Daily Sync**
   - Option A: Use Render Cron Jobs (recommended)
   - Option B: Enable cron job in server code
   - Suggested schedule: Daily at 6 AM and 6 PM

3. **Test Query Functionality**
   ```bash
   POST /api/email-analytics/query
   Body: { "query": "Show all PTO requests from last 7 days" }
   ```

### Long Term (This Month)
1. Set up monitoring/alerting for:
   - Failed syncs
   - Missing emails
   - API rate limits
   
2. Review and tune categorization accuracy

3. Build dashboard for email metrics
