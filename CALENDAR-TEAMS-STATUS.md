# 🎉 Calendar & Teams Sync - Phase 1 Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### Database Tables (Created & Live)

**1. `calendar_events` Table**
- Stores calendar events with Claude AI analysis
- Fields: event details + categories, priorities, topics, action items
- Indexes for fast queries by date, organizer, category, priority

**2. `teams_messages` Table**  
- Stores Teams messages with Claude AI analysis
- Fields: message details + sentiment, urgency, topics, action items
- Indexes for fast queries by date, team, channel, sender

**3. Pre-Built Views**
- `upcoming_meetings` - Meetings starting from now
- `high_priority_meetings` - High-priority upcoming meetings
- `recent_teams_activity` - Last 7 days of Teams messages
- `urgent_teams_messages` - Urgent messages from last 7 days
- `meeting_summary_by_category` - Meeting stats by category
- `teams_activity_by_channel` - Activity stats by channel

### Services Created

**Analysis Services (Claude AI):**
- ✅ `claudeCalendarService.mjs` - Analyze calendar events
  - Extract categories (Meeting, Review, Planning, Training, etc.)
  - Determine priority (high/medium/low)
  - Identify key topics
  - Extract action items

- ✅ `claudeTeamsService.mjs` - Analyze Teams messages  
  - Extract categories (Announcement, Question, Update, Decision, etc.)
  - Determine sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)
  - Assess urgency (urgent/normal/low)
  - Identify key topics and action items

**Sync Services:**
- ✅ `calendarSyncService.mjs` - Fetch calendar from Microsoft → PostgreSQL
- ✅ `teamsSyncService.mjs` - Fetch Teams messages from Microsoft → PostgreSQL

### Scripts
- ✅ `init_calendar_teams_db.mjs` - Initialize database tables (EXECUTED ✅)

## 📊 Database Status

```
✅ Tables Created Successfully:
  • calendar_events
  • teams_messages

✅ Views Created:
  • upcoming_meetings
  • recent_teams_activity
  • high_priority_meetings
  • urgent_teams_messages
  • meeting_summary_by_category
  • teams_activity_by_channel

Status: READY FOR SYNC
```

## 🚀 Next Steps (Phase 2)

### 1. Add API Endpoints (To Be Added)

Need to add to `server/index.mjs`:

```javascript
// Initialize database (already done, but add endpoint for future)
POST /api/calendar-teams/initialize

// Sync calendar events
POST /api/calendar/sync
{
  "daysBack": 30,
  "daysForward": 90
}

// Sync Teams messages
POST /api/teams/sync
{
  "daysBack": 30
}

// Sync both at once
POST /api/calendar-teams/sync-all
```

### 2. Integrate into Smart Agent

Add detection and querying for calendar/Teams queries:

```javascript
// Detect calendar queries
if (isCalendarQuery(message)) {
  const { sql } = await generateCalendarQuery(message);
  const results = await pool.query(sql);
  const formatted = await formatCalendarResults(results.rows, message);
  return formatted;
}

// Detect Teams queries
if (isTeamsQuery(message)) {
  const { sql } = await generateTeamsQuery(message);
  const results = await pool.query(sql);
  const formatted = await formatTeamsResults(results.rows, message);
  return formatted;
}
```

### 3. First Sync (After Endpoints Added)

```bash
# Sync calendar (last 30 days + next 90 days)
POST /api/calendar/sync
{
  "daysBack": 30,
  "daysForward": 90
}

# Sync Teams (last 30 days)
POST /api/teams/sync
{
  "daysBack": 30
}
```

### 4. Test Smart Agent Queries

Once synced, these queries will work:

**Calendar:**
- "What meetings does Rudy have this week?"
- "Show me upcoming high-priority meetings"
- "What deadlines are coming up?"
- "Meetings with action items"

**Teams:**
- "What did the team discuss today?"
- "Show me urgent Teams messages"
- "Recent project updates"
- "What decisions were made this week?"

**Combined:**
- "What are Rudy's priorities?" (emails + calendar + Teams)
- "Show me everything urgent" (all sources)
- "What action items do I have?" (from all communications)

## 🎯 How It Works

### Data Flow:
```
Microsoft Graph API
  ↓
Fetch calendar events / Teams messages
  ↓
Claude analyzes each item
  ├─ Categories
  ├─ Priorities
  ├─ Topics
  ├─ Action items
  └─ Sentiment (Teams only)
  ↓
Store in PostgreSQL
  ↓
Smart Agent queries PostgreSQL (fast!)
  ↓
Claude formats results
  ↓
User gets answer
```

### Benefits:
- ⚡ **Fast**: No real-time API calls during queries
- 🎯 **Smart**: Pre-analyzed by Claude
- 🧹 **Unified**: All data in PostgreSQL (emails, calendar, Teams)
- 📈 **Scalable**: Can handle thousands of events/messages

## 📋 What's Already Working

✅ Database schema created  
✅ Tables and indexes ready  
✅ Views for common queries ready
