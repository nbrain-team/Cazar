# Table Formatting Enhancement

## Issue

Agent was returning data like this:
```
Drivers with violations:
- G38G86G9HBBW01QR (3 shifts)
- G3GW58RQF1QN2MZY (3 shifts)
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå Shows driver IDs, not names
- ‚ùå Not in table format
- ‚ùå Missing key information (hours worked, lunch status, etc.)
- ‚ùå Not actionable (have to look up each driver ID)

---

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced SQL Queries with JOINs

**New break_violations query:**
```sql
SELECT 
  dw.driver_id,
  dw.driver_name,           -- ‚úÖ Includes name!
  dw.work_date,
  dw.total_minutes,
  ROUND(dw.total_minutes / 60.0, 1) as hours_worked,  -- ‚úÖ Calculated hours
  COALESCE(lb.break_count, 0) as lunch_breaks_taken,
  COALESCE(lb.break_minutes, 0) as lunch_break_minutes,
  CASE 
    WHEN COALESCE(lb.break_count, 0) = 0 THEN '‚ùå NO LUNCH'
    WHEN COALESCE(lb.break_minutes, 0) < 30 THEN '‚ö†Ô∏è SHORT LUNCH'
    ELSE '‚úÖ OK'
  END as lunch_status                    -- ‚úÖ Visual status
FROM daily_work dw
LEFT JOIN lunch_breaks lb ...
```

**New consecutive_days query:**
```sql
SELECT 
  driver_id,
  driver_name,              -- ‚úÖ Includes name!
  streak_start,
  streak_end,
  consecutive_days,
  CASE 
    WHEN consecutive_days >= 7 THEN 'üö® CRITICAL'
    WHEN consecutive_days >= 6 THEN '‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING'
    ELSE '‚úÖ OK'
  END as status
FROM streaks
```

### 2. Updated System Prompt

Added instructions to ALWAYS use markdown tables:
```
- **ALWAYS present tabular data in markdown tables with proper columns**
- For driver queries, ALWAYS include: Driver Name, Hours/Days, Status, and relevant metrics
- Use emojis for status indicators (‚úÖ OK, ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING, üö® CRITICAL, ‚ùå VIOLATION)
- Make outputs ACTIONABLE - include all relevant data in tables
```

---

## Expected Output After Fix

### Query: "List drivers who worked 6+ hours without lunch"

**Agent will return:**

```markdown
## üö® Lunch Break Compliance Violations

Found 8 drivers who worked 6+ hours without taking a lunch break:

| Driver Name | Date | Hours Worked | Lunch Breaks | Break Minutes | Status |
|-------------|------|--------------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| John Smith | 2025-10-29 | 8.5 | 0 | 0 | ‚ùå NO LUNCH |
| Maria Garcia | 2025-10-29 | 7.2 | 0 | 0 | ‚ùå NO LUNCH |
| David Chen | 2025-10-28 | 9.1 | 0 | 0 | ‚ùå NO LUNCH |
| Sarah Johnson | 2025-10-28 | 6.8 | 1 | 20 | ‚ö†Ô∏è SHORT LUNCH |
| Michael Brown | 2025-10-27 | 7.5 | 0 | 0 | ‚ùå NO LUNCH |
| Lisa Anderson | 2025-10-27 | 8.2 | 0 | 0 | ‚ùå NO LUNCH |
| Robert Taylor | 2025-10-26 | 6.5 | 0 | 0 | ‚ùå NO LUNCH |
| Jennifer Lee | 2025-10-26 | 7.8 | 0 | 0 | ‚ùå NO LUNCH |

**Compliance Summary:**
- Total violations: 8 drivers
- No lunch taken: 7 drivers  
- Short lunch (<30 min): 1 driver
- Average hours without break: 7.7 hours

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Immediate follow-up with all 8 drivers
2. Review break policy compliance training
3. Implement automated break reminders
4. Schedule manager review for repeat offenders
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Full driver names (not IDs)
- ‚úÖ All relevant columns
- ‚úÖ Clear visual status indicators
- ‚úÖ Summary statistics
- ‚úÖ Actionable recommendations
- ‚úÖ Professional table format

**Returns:** Driver name, date, hours worked, lunch breaks taken, status

### 2. consecutive_days
**Use for:** "Drivers working too many consecutive days"
**Returns:** Driver name, streak dates, consecutive days, status

### 3. timecards
**Returns:** Timecard data WITH driver names (JOINed)

### 4. violations

## System Prompt Updates

The agent now knows to:
1. Present driver data in **markdown tables**
2. Include **all relevant columns**
3. Add **visual status indicators** (emojis)
4. Provide **summary statistics**
5. Make **actionable recommendations**

---

## Deployment

‚úÖ Enhanced SQL queries pushed  
‚úÖ System prompt updated  
‚è≥ Deploying to Render (~3 min)

After deployment, queries like:
- "List drivers without lunch breaks"
- "Drivers working too many consecutive days"
- "Show break violations with full details"

Will all return beautiful, actionable tables with complete information!
