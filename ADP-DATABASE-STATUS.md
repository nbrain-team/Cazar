## 🤖 AI Smart Agent Access

The AI Smart Agent can now query ADP employee data using SQL through the database service.

### Example Queries

**Get all active employees:**
```sql
SELECT driver_id, driver_name, hire_date 
FROM drivers 
WHERE employment_status = 'active' 
ORDER BY hire_date DESC;
```

**Get employees hired in last 3 months:**
```sql
SELECT driver_id, driver_name, hire_date, employment_status
FROM drivers 
WHERE hire_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '3 months'
ORDER BY hire_date DESC;
```

**Get employee count by status:**
```sql
SELECT employment_status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM drivers
GROUP BY employment_status;
```

**Search for specific employee:**
```sql
SELECT driver_id, driver_name, employment_status, hire_date
FROM drivers
WHERE driver_name ILIKE '%alexander%';
```

**Get recent hires:**
```sql
SELECT driver_name, hire_date, employment_status
FROM drivers
WHERE hire_date IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY hire_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Status:** Working perfectly - no supervisor assignment needed!

## 📝 Smart Agent Query Examples

When users ask the Smart Agent about ADP data, it can answer questions like:

**"How many active employees do we have?"**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM drivers WHERE employment_status = 'active';
-- Result: 210 active employees
```

**"Who was hired most recently?"**
```sql
SELECT driver_name, hire_date FROM drivers 
WHERE hire_date IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY hire_date DESC LIMIT 1;
-- Result: Alexander, Bernard (Sep 30, 2025)
```

**"List all employees hired in September 2025"**

SELECT driver_name, hire_date, employment_status 
FROM drivers 
WHERE hire_date >= '2025-09-01' AND hire_date < '2025-10-01'
ORDER BY hire_date DESC;
```

**"Show me terminated employees from ADP"**
```sql
SELECT driver_id, driver_name, hire_date 
FROM drivers 
WHERE employment_status = 'terminated'
