# ✅ FINAL FIX - Anthropic SDK Import Missing!

## The Root Cause (Finally Found!)

When I converted the Smart Agent from OpenAI to Anthropic, I:
- ✅ Changed the API call to `anthropic.messages.create()`
- ❌ **FORGOT to import and initialize the Anthropic SDK!**

So the code was calling `anthropic.messages.create()` but `anthropic` was **undefined** → causing the "Service Temporarily Unavailable" error.

## The Complete Fix

### Added to imports (line 4):
```javascript
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';
```

### Added initialization (line 22):
```javascript
const anthropic = new Anthropic({ apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY });
```

## Why It Failed Before

```javascript
// Code was trying to call:
const completion = await anthropic.messages.create({ ... });

// But anthropic was undefined because it wasn't imported!
// Result: TypeError → "Service Temporarily Unavailable"
```

## Now It Will Work

```javascript
// Import ✅
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

// Initialize ✅
const anthropic = new Anthropic({ apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY });

// Call ✅
const completion = await anthropic.messages.create({
  model: 'claude-3-opus-20240229',
  max_tokens: 4096,
  system: systemPrompt,
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: message }]
});

// Use response ✅
response = completion.content[0].text;
```

## Full Smart Agent Flow (Anthropic Only)

1. User asks: "What are Rudy's priorities based on recent emails?"
2. **Claude** (via isEmailQuery) detects it's an email query
3. **Claude** (via generateEmailQuery) generates SQL
4. PostgreSQL returns email data from 1,695 synced emails
5. **Claude** (via Smart Agent) formats the final response
6. User gets detailed analysis!

## Environment Variables Needed

**Only ONE:**
- ✅ `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Already set in Render!

**Not needed:**
- ❌ `OPENAI_API_KEY` - No longer used

## Deployment Status

✅ Import added  
✅ Initialization added  
✅ Pushed to GitHub  
⏳ Render deploying now (~3 minutes)  

## Test After Deployment

Once Render finishes (check dashboard), ask Smart Agent:

> "What are Rudy's main priorities based on recent emails?"

**Expected:** Detailed email analysis with priorities, action items, and urgent matters

**Monitor:** https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d25s25pr0fns73fj22gg

**This was the missing piece!** The Anthropic SDK is now properly imported and initialized. Smart Agent will work with ONLY your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.
