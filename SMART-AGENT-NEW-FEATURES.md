# Smart Agent New Features - Training Feedback & Chat History

## ✅ Feature 1: Training Feedback System

### '+' Button on Assistant Messages
Every assistant response now has an "Add Training Feedback" button at the bottom.

**How it works:**
1. User clicks the '+' button on any assistant message
2. Modal popup appears with:
   - Comment text box
   - Conversation summary (message count, databases used)
   - Save/Cancel buttons

3. User enters feedback/comments
4. Clicks "Save Feedback"
5. Entire conversation + feedback saved to `training_data.jsonl`

### Data Saved:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-31T06:36:21.000Z",
  "databases_used": ["Email Analytics", "Operations Database"],
  "feedback": "Great response but need more details on Fleet priorities",
  "conversation": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What are Rudy's priorities?",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-31T06:35:00.000Z"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Based on analysis...",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-31T06:35:05.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "message_count": 4
}
```

### File Format:
- **JSONL** (JSON Lines) - one conversation per line
- **Location:** `training_data.jsonl` (git-ignored, won't be committed)
- **Easy to process:** Can be parsed line-by-line for training analysis

### Use Cases:
- Mark good responses: "This was perfect!"
- Note missing info: "Needs more Fleet details"
- Suggest improvements: "Should include driver names not IDs"
- Report errors: "SQL query failed for this question"

## ✅ Feature 2: Chat History

### History Button in Header
Shows count of saved conversations: "History (5)"

   - Title (first 50 chars of first question)
   - Message count
   - Date and time
   - Current chat highlighted

4. Click any chat to resume it
5. Chat loads and conversation continues
6. Delete button (X) to remove chats

### Auto-Save:
- **Automatically saves** every conversation to localStorage
- **No manual save needed** - happens as you chat
- **Persists across page refreshes**
- **Resumes from where you left off**

### Features:
- ✅ View all past conversations
